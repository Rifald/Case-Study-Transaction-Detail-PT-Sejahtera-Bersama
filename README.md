# Case-Study-Transaction-Detail-PT-Sejahtera-Bersama

Documentation of a case study about transaction detail PT. Sejahtera Bersama. I did this Case Study when I was taking a Virtual Internship Experience in Bank Muamalat.
In the case study, there are 4 tables that can be analyzed
1. Orders table : records all the orders placed by the customer.
2. Product Category table : records the details of the product categories.
3. Products table : records the details of the products sold, including the price, and brand.
4. Customers table : records the details of the the customers data.

### Ask
The first step, I determine what things can be analyzed to help solve problems that exist in the company
1. How is the development of sales monthly at the company?
2. how the sales progress by category?
3. How to increase sales?
4. Which city makes the most purchases?

### Prepare
To answer the question, I saw and analyzed from 4 tables, what data can be taken from the three tables to answer the question.

### Process
Before analyze the data, do checking and data cleaning first, such as checking for null values or improper values that allow errors to occur.

### Analyze
After determining what data is needed, I implement it using <a href="https://github.com/Rifald/Study-Case-Transaction-Detail-PT-Sejahtera-Bersama/blob/main/Query/query.sql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL</a> to get the required data. After that I make a visualization using Tableau based on the data that has been taken.
